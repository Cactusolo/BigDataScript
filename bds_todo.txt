- Defered Task:
	dep( out <- in ) sys ....

	Only executed if required

- Thread / Process 

	parallel {
		...
		any valid BDS block (e.g. a function call)
	}

	parallel returns an ID which we can 'wait' on


	=> Problem: How does it communicate with the rest of the workd?

- Mutiple assignment 

	( a, b, c ) := ( 'hi', 3.14, 7 )

- Better interpolation

	print "Not only $var is interpolated, but also ${array[76]} and ${map[function(45)]} is interpolated as well"

	=> Syntax sugar for

	print "Not only $var is interpolated, but also " + array[76] + " and " + map[function(45)] + " is interpolated as well"

- SWITCH statement
